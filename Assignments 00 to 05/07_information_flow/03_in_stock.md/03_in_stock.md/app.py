# Sophia has a fruit store. She has written a function num_in_stock which takes a string fruit as a parameter and returns how many of that fruit are in her inventory. Write code in main() which will:
# Prompt the user to enter a fruit ("Enter a fruit: ")
# Call num_in_stock(fruit) to get the number of that fruit that Sophia has in stock
# Print the number which are in stock if Sophia has that fruit in her inventory (there are more than 0 in stock)
# Print "This fruit is not in stock." if Sophia has none of that fruit in her inventory.
# Here's two sample runs of the program (user input in bold italics):
# Enter a fruit: pear
# This fruit is in stock! Here is how many:
# 1000
# Enter a fruit: lychee
# This fruit is not in stock.
