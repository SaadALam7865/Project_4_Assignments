# Implement the following function which takes in 3 integers as parameters:

# def in_range(n, low, high) """ Returns True if n is between low and high, inclusive. high is guaranteed to be greater than low. """

def in_range(n, low, high):
    """
    Returns True if n is between low and high, inclusive. 
    high is guaranteed to be greater than low.
    """
    if n >= low and n <= high:
        return True
    return False

# Sample usage
print(in_range(7, 5, 10))  # True
print(in_range(3, 5, 10))  # False
